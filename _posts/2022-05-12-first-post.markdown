This is a my first official post. As I do this more, hopefully the structure and content flows a little bit more.

## Creating this post

Creating this post was mostly manual. I may create a python script to generate blog templates. The command shown below was used to generate an empty file for this post. More to come...

```bash
$ touch $(date +%Y-%m-%d)-first-post.markdown
```
